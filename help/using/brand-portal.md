# Overview of Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal {#overview-of-aem-assets-brand-portal}

As a marketer, you sometimes need to collaborate with channel partners and internal business users to quickly create, manage, and deliver relevant digital content to customers. Timely delivery of relevant content across the entire customer journey is critical to driving greater demand, conversion, engagement, and customer loyalty.

However, it is a challenge to develop solutions that support efficient and secure sharing of approved brand logos, guidelines, campaign assets, or product shots with extended internal teams, partners, and resellers.

**Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets Brand Portal** focuses on the marketer’s need to effectively collaborate with the globally distributed Brand Portal users by providing asset distribution and asset contribution capabilities.

Asset distribution allows you to easily acquire, control, and securely distribute approved creative assets to external parties and internal business users across devices. Whereas, Asset contribution enables the Brand Portal users with the ability to upload assets to Brand Portal and publish to Experience Manager Assets, without needing access to the author environment. The contribution feature is called as **Assets Sourcing in Brand Portal**. And together, it improves the overall Brand Portal experience of asset distribution and contribution from the Brand Portal users (external agencies/teams), accelerates the time-to-market for assets, and reduces the risk of non-compliance and unauthorized access.
See, [Asset Sourcing in Brand Portal](brand-portal-asset-sourcing.md).

The browser-based portal environment enables you to easily upload, browse, search, preview, and export assets in approved formats.

## Configure Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal {#configure-brand-portal}

Configuring Adobe Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal enables asset publishing, asset distribution, and asset contribution features for the Brand Portal users. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Configuring Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal is supported on Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service, Experience Manager Assets 6.3 and above.

Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service is automatically configured with Brand Portal by activating Brand Portal from the Cloud Manager. The activation workflow creates the required configurations at the backend and activates Brand Portal on the same IMS org as of the Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service instance.  

Whereas, Experience Manager Assets (on premise and managed service) is manually configured with Brand Portal using Adobe Developer Console, which procures an Adobe Identity Management Services (IMS) token for authorization of the Brand Portal tenant. 

For more information, see [configuring Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal](../using/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.md).

### Guest user {#guest-user}

Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal allows [guest access](#request-access-to-brand-portal) to Brand Portal.

As a guest user, you can browse through asset details and have full asset view of members of public folders and collections. You can search, download, and add public assets to [!UICONTROL Lightbox] collection.

However, guest session restricts you from creating collections and saved searches, and share them further. Users in a guest session cannot access folder and collections settings, and cannot share assets as link. Here is a list of tasks that a guest user can perform:

## Alternate alias for Brand Portal url {#tenant-alias-for-portal-url}

Brand Portal 6.4.3 onwards, organizations can have one alternate (alias) URL for existing URL of their Brand Portal tenant. The alias URL can be created by having an alternate prefix in the URL.  
Note that only the prefix of the Brand Portal URL can be customized and not the entire URL. For example, an organization with existing domain `geomettrix.brand-portal.adobe.com` can get `geomettrixinc.brand-portal.adobe.com` created on request.

However, AEM Author instance can be [configured](../using/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.md) only with the tenant id URL and not with tenant alias (alternate) URL.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To get an alias for tenant name in existing portal URL, organizations need to contact Customer support with a new tenant alias creation request. This request is processed by first checking if the alias is available and then creating the alias.
>
>To replace the old or delete the old alias, the same process needs to be followed.
